_My favorite personal project!_

https://github.com/AThilenius/logic-paint-rs

- Based on a game by Zachtronics called [KOHCTPYKTOP](https://www.zachtronics.com/kohctpyktop-engineer-of-the-people/), which sadly isn't playable any more because it's a flash game
- Written in Rust (because of course it is)
- Compiled to WASM
- Uses WebGL2 for fixed-cost (by pixels) hardware accelerated rendering
  - Each 'cell' is a single 16 bit unsigned texel and rendered entirely in a fragment shader.
- Lets you edit and simulate transistors (something between BJT and CMOS, for you hardware people)

Once I finished with the editor I then built a functional 16 bit CPU in it, modeled after the [CL-3B ISA](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/05f.360N/handouts/360n.appC.pdf). It's micro-coded with a common 16-bit bus, 8 registers with dual output and a 16K of RAM (not drawn here).

![CPU](https://github.com/AThilenius/logic-paint-rs/blob/main/misc/screenshots/logic-paint-cpu.png?raw=true)

I love this project dearly, because it requires knowledge of how a computer works all the way from the transistor up to WASM running in Chromium. Next up is a toy language with a homemade compiler for it üòä Have to rewrite my parser-generator first though!
